# Stock Price Predictive Analytics Project

In this project from my Time Series Analysis course at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020 my group and I:

- Explored and modeled Mediocre Social Network Apps Incorporated’s stock data using time series analysis methods on its daily historical prices
- We predict prices for the next ten trading days using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing models
- We apply time series exploratory techniques such as analyzing ACF/PACF plots, differencing, and applying a variance-stabilizing transform on the data in pursuit of homoskedasticity
- After comparing individual model metrics and diagnostics, we collectively decided to implement a ”random walk” ARIMA(0,1,0) model in order to make the most accurate and realistic stock price predictions based on empirical analysis and stock market theory
